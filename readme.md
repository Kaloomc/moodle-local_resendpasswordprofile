This plugin allows users to resend their passwords through an additional menu in the "My Profile" section of Moodle. It is a simple and efficient solution to help users recover access to their accounts.

## Features

- Adds an option in the "My Profile" menu to resend the password to the email address associated with the user's account.

## Installation

### Requirements

## Customization

The automatic email sent when resending a password uses the following language string:
